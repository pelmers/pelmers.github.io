### Hey there!
<p class="message">
<i>I'm Peter</i>, currently a sophomore at Rice University anticipating a BS in Computer Science in 2017.
You can see some of my recent projects below.
Feel free to shoot me an e-mail if you have any questions or if you'd just like to say hello.
</p>

## Some fairly recent projects

* [PlanMe](http://plan-me.appspot.com), short-term task planner
  - Give it your calendar, what you need to do in the next 5 days and how long each task will take, and PlanMe fills in your calendar such that you complete tasks on time.
  - Optionally indicate preferences such as preferring to work in the mornings or afternoons, or preferring to finish tasks right before they're due.
* [CodeCrammer](http://codecrammer.appspot.com), creative code minifier
  - Reshape and minify Javascript (other languages possibly coming soon) code into fun shapes.
* [Int-en](http://int-en.appspot.com), numbers to English
  - Convert any number to English: supports scientific notation, decimals, and negative numbers.
  - Also supports evaluating simple mathematical expressions, such as `100**3000` (using Python notation)
  - I'm not even sure what the upper bound is!
* [HJ-Viz](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2660252.2660395), tool to visualize the computational graphs of parallel programs
  - Written for HJ-lib programs, the tool parses event logs generated at run time and reconstructs the computational graph.
  - Web-based interface written in Python with Flask, with frontend code in Javascript.
  - Presented at SPLASH conference 2014, Portland, US.
* [Wave](http://github.com/pelmers/wave), make colored sine waves in the terminal
  - Fun little program written in Go which draws sine waves down the terminal window indefinitely.
  - Can customize amplitude, frequency, color, letters, and numbers of the waves.
  - Written to learn goroutines: each sine wave runs in its own goroutine.
* [bars.svg.js](http://github.com/pelmers/bars.svg.js), simple to use animated bar charts
  - Updating values in the chart automatically triggers animations.
* Contributing to open source! [DXR](http://dxr.mozilla.org), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org),
    [Rice Elections](http://owlection.appspot.com), [others](https://github.com/pelmers)...
