### About me and about this blog

I'm Peter Elmers, sophomore at Rice University and fan of many things open source.

This blog will mainly follow my exploration of interesting technical challenges I encounter and cool (to me, at least!) new projects I work on.
Sometimes I may, however, delve into non-technical topics if something important pulls my attention.
It's hosted on Github pages and built with Jekyll, using the excellent scaffolding provided by [Poole](http://getpoole.com).
I plan to post at least once every couple of weeks, hopefully more often if time permits.
Feel free to subscribe to the [RSS feed](/atom.xml) to receive updates.
